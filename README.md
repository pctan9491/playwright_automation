## 📂 Project Structure

- **`tests/`**: Contains your test files (e.g., `example.spec.ts`, `lesson-1-basics.spec.ts`).
- **`playwright.config.ts`**: Configuration for browsers, timeouts, and parallel execution.
- **`package.json`**: Dependencies and scripts.

## 📝 Learning Roadmap

1.  **Basics**: Opening pages, clicking, filling forms (`lesson-1-basics.spec.ts`).
2.  **Locators**: How to find elements efficiently.
3.  **Assertions**: Verifying that the page behaves as expected.
4.  **Trace Viewer**: Debugging failed tests.
